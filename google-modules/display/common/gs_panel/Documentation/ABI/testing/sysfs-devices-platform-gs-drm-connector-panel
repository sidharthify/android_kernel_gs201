Contact: "Taylor Nelms" <tknelms@google.com>
Description:
  Userspace client can use to view or override whether idle mode is
  possible for the panel.
  Idle mode allows the panel to aggressively change its internal refresh rate
  when the panel is expected to be idle for a large length of time.
  Usually, idle mode becomes active when self-refresh mode is activated.

  Userspace client uses this to check whether the flag for the panel needing
  special handling to exit idle mode is on or off, or to override its value.
  Some panels may need special handling when exiting idle mode because of clock or
  bandwidth requirements due to the idle mode TE rate. This file exposes the flag
  controlling this behavior to userspace.

Contact: "Kevin Ying" <kevinying@google.com>
Description:
  Userspace client uses this to read vendor DDIC color data on supported panels. The client
  first writes a configuration string, e.g. "1 0" for luminance segment 0, then reads the
  corresponding color data while the panel is active. For each configuration string, a
  fixed result will be returned specific to the panel. Fake data can also be injected with
  "2 <byte offset> <data>" where <data> is up to 3 2-byte integers.

What: /sys/devices/platform/gs-drm-connector/panel/frame_rate
Date: June 2024
KernelVersion: 6.1
Contact: "Jeremy DeHaan" <jdehaan@google.com>
Description:
  Userspace client uses this to write the current frame rate. This is to inform the panel about
  the frequency of frames exiting the OS's display management system (such as SurfaceFlinger),
  in cases where that information may affect a particular panel's behavior. Not all panels
  need (or support) this feature. Setting this value directly will not affect the
  refresh_rate of the panel. The unit is frames per second.
