What:		/sys/class/gxp/gxp/device/load_firmware
Date:		June 2022
Description:
		To load an MCU firmware file, write the OS firmware location-relative path of the
		firmware image file to load to this attribute.  For example:
		  # echo google/my-test.fw > /sys/class/gxp/gxp/device/load_firmware
		Read this file to see the name of the currently-loaded firmware image name.
Users:		GXP runtime library (libgxp)

What:		/sys/class/gxp/gxp/device/load_dsp_firmware
Date:		April 2022
Description:
		To load DSP firmware files, write the OS firmware location-relative path of the
		firmware image file name prefix to this attribute.  For example:
		  # echo gxp_callisto_fw_core > /sys/class/gxp/gxp/device/load_dsp_firmware
		Read this file to see the name of the currently-loaded firmware image name prefix.
		The firmware files to be loaded are the name suffixed with number starts from 0.
		In above example the firmware files to be loaded are gxp_callisto_fw_core0,
		gxp_callisto_fw_core1, etc. How many firmware to be loaded depends on how many DSP
		cores are there on the system and is decided by the GXP kernel driver.

What:		/sys/class/gxp/gxp/device/firmware_version
Date:		June 2023
Description:
		Firmware google3 build CL and its privilege (either secure or non-secure):
		  # cat /sys/class/gxp/gxp/device/firmware_version

# Error Statistics
# These statistics are maintained by the kernel driver.

What:		/sys/class/gxp/gxp/device/firmware_crash_counter
Date:		September 2023
Description:
		Count of “unrecoverable” MCU firmware crash events; does not include “non-fatal”
		crashes on DSP core failures.  (No clear action.)
Users:		GXP runtime library (libgxp)

# Performance/Usage Statistics
# These stats are gathered from the firmware at device power down time.  Reading the sysfs file will
# immediately poll for updated values if the device is currently powered on; if the device is
# powered down then the last received value is returned.
