Description:
		Workaround for read-only CHG_DETAILS_03 to track exiting from shipmode.
                MAX77759_PMIC_TOPSYS_INT_MASK_SPR_7 is used to detect exit from fshipmode.
                The register (MAX77759_PMIC_TOPSYS_INT_MASK) is type S and the bit is reset
                to 1 on power loss. The reports MAX77759_CHG_DETAILS_03 when the bit
                is 1 and report 0 when the bit is set to 0.
